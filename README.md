# Freespace-ORCA
Use the run.m to run the file. 
While naming the agents make sure that the name for the agents are in order, i.e , first agent in the array is named 1 , second 2, etc.

getintersection.m - gets the intersection of the legs of VO Cone with the freespace square.
constructpoly - to construct VO obstacles
allotment_weights.m - Allot weights and find the minimum side
dividevshape.m - To divide the freespace into left and right freespaces.
getControls.m - Optimisation (fmincon)
getsideConstraints.m - VO optimisation constraints
getConstraints_orca_l.m , getConstraints_orca_r.m - Nonlinear ORCA constraints.
getdist_orca.m and getConstrols.m - for linear ORCA constraints.
